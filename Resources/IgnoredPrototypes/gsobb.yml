# IgnoredPrototypes is the biggest bullshit ever. It's only real use is for ignoring Guidebook prototypes,
# and even THEN it sucks at that. Actual fucking bullshit.
#
# It's a "soft-ignore" prototype file. I wish it was a "hard-ignore" where you could just ignore a whole file
# and then create a prototype replacing that file to prevent merge conflicts. It would've been the best tool
# for forks if it weren't ass.

# NOPE. YOU CANT EVEN TAKE AWAY THE GUIDEBOOK. YOU WILL GET A THOUSAND YAML ERRORS. WHAT THE FUCK IS THE
# POINT OF THIS THING??? IT "REGISTERS" THE PROTOTYPE UNDER AN ID AND PREVENTS OTHER PROTOTYPES FROM
# TAKING THAT ID, AND WHILST YES IT DOES "IGNORE PROTOTYPES" IT'S A MASSIVE PAIN IN THE ASS THAT
# JUST HANDLING THE FUCKING MERGE CONFLICTS YOURSELF IS AN EASIER SOLUTION.
